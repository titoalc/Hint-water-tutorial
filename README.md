# Hint-water-tutorial
this is a tutorial about how do water transparency in sega genesis mega drive using the Hint to simulate, because sega genesis can't do real transparencies, except for the highlight/shadows mode.
To run this code you need install the SGDK library, and to compile, use the makefile project or build.bat archive and open the rom.bin archive with a genesis emulator, like gens.

for collisions and resources i use a example into tile16 program from iuri nery.
